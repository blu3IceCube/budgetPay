This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then make sure your PC/Laptop is connected to the same network as your mobile.

Open console/command prompt on your PC/Laptop and find your device IP address using `ipconfig` on windows or `ifconfig` on MAC and Linux.

Once you get your device's IPv4 Address, replace the localhost with this IP in your mobile's browser. 

For eg: If your server is running on `localhost:3000` and your IPv4 is `192.168.0.0` then you should type `192.168.0.0:3000` in your mobile browser search bar. 

Your application should now preview on mobile.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
